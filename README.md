# hire-me-databento
Databento Team, You should hire me as an intern

## I'm in the ideation phase here, trying to figure out a good project to build as a portfolio project
- ideas: Add a databento like implementation for non-traditional exchange (simplified)
  - Probably for a single Symbol
  - Crypto? decentralized could make my implementation actually useful from a design perspective. Don't have the advantage of co-location, FPGA's, etc

- Build some functionality over Databento
  - paper trading over historical data?
      - (This would not include any market reactions to user action)
